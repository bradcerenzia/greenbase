greenbase
=========

Greenbase holds the imagery/database logic for organizing the climate change ecosystem. It is being migrated to operate within WordPress
The current version of this is hosted at "greenbase.org" and we're currently in the process of getting this up and running.

Major TODO's:
<UL>
<LI> Add the database schema to the check in
<LI> Make more of the PHP components modulized so we can separate the content from the logic, where the snapshot itself will be the hardest part
</UL>
